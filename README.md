# Employee_Attrition
The primary objective of this project is to analyze employee attrition data to identify key factors that contribute to employee turnover. By leveraging the Databricks platform, we aim to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and visualize the insights to aid in decision-making.
